# Uml Parser

This application will take the Java code and generate UML diagram for the classes. It would be able to show the relationship like Association, Aggregation etc between the classes. We will be using the below mentioned tools and libraries for it.

# Tools and Libraries Used:

1. Antlr
(ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

2. Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

3. yUML
yUML is an online tool for creating and publishing simple UML diagrams. It can be used to create class and other UML diagrams. 

Note: This is a live document and would be updated from time to time.
